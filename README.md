# pfUI-ProfessionCDs
A pfUI extention for keeping track of your profession CDs across all of your alts.

## To enable, open your pfUI settings, go to **Panel** then change one of the `Left Panel` or `Right Panel`
You will also need to manually open up your Alchemy and Tailoring professions once

**TODO**

* (Optional) Minimap button with it's own interface, with profession CDs display. (Removes pfUI dependency)
* Multi-Account support via SuperWoW.
